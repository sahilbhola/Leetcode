/*https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/
Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.

/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
select request_at as Day, round((sum(case when (t.status='cancelled_by_driver' or t.status='cancelled_by_client') then 1 else 0 end)/count(*)),2) as "Cancellation Rate" from trips t
where t.request_at >= '2013-10-01' and t.request_at <= '2013-10-03'
and t.client_id in (select users_id from users u where u.banned='No') 
and t.driver_id in (select users_id from users u where u.banned='No')
group by t.request_at
order by t.request_at;
