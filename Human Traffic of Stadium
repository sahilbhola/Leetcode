/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
--Solution1
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
select id, visit_date, people from (select id, visit_date, people, count(*) over (partition by diff) as cnt from (
select id, visit_date, people, (id-rnk) as diff from (select id, TO_CHAR(visit_date,'yyyy-mm-dd') as visit_date, people, row_number() over (order by visit_date) as rnk from stadium where people>=100))) where cnt>=3  order by id;

--Solution2
with t as 
(select * from stadium where people>=100)
select id, TO_CHAR(visit_date,'YYYY-MM-DD') as visit_date, people from t t4 where t4.id in (select t1.id from t t1, t t2, t t3 where
t1.id<t2.id and t2.id<t3.id
and abs(t1.id-t2.id)=1 and abs(t1.id-t3.id)=2
union all
